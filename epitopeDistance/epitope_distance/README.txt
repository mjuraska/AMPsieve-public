A Python program to calculate epitope distance

It composed of two tools: 
    1. "get_wts.py" - calculate the interaction weight of epitope sites based
       on given Ab:ag complex structure. "./get_wts.py -h" for details.
    2. "ep_dist.py" - calculate the epitope distance based on the prepared 
       alignment and the precalculated interaction weigth. "./ep_dist.py -h" 
       for details.

Please check "example" folder for examples.
